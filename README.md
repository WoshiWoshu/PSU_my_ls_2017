# PSU_my_ls_2017
First year mini project in C in which the goal is to re-code the ls UNIX system call/command.
It can handle most of the ls options in either order as "-lRdrt".
It can also pass a list of files/folders as parameter.

USING :
      
    Make
    
    ./my_ls [-lRdrt] [FILE].

EXEMPLE : 

    > ./my_ls libmy

    > ./my_ls .
